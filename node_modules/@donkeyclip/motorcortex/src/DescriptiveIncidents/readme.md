# Descriptive Incidents

In MotorCortex we follow a pattern (we call it the "Description Pattern"). This pattern allows us
to define a Clip via Classes that are only meant to describe the Incident via its attrs and props.
Adding Descriptive Incidents within other Descriptive Incidents (e.g. adding a CSSEffect to a Descriptive
Group or a Descriptive Clip) forms a tree of Descriptive Incidents.

Under the hood, MotorCortex "compiles" this tree to a tree of "real" Incidents which are Incidents
that

- extend MonoIncident (we call them `Effects` and an example is CSSEffect)
- or Group
- or MediaPlayIncident (or Classes that extend it)
- or Clips extending the ExtendableClip

The core of MotorCortex supports the (Descriptive) Combos, Groups and Incidents (Effects). In order
for a Clip type to be defined and implemented we need to create its DescriptiveClip implementation,
exactly as we've done on file `Browser/DescriptiveClip`.

The files positioned on the root of this folder belong to MotorCortex core and a specific Clip type
implementation should not affect them.
