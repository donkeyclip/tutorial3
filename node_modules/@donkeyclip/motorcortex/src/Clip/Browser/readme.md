# Browser Clip

Browser (or DOM) Clip is the implementation of a MotorCortex Clip to run on the Browser. For the
implementation of any type of Clip the developer should:

- Define the Core Clip of the implementation by extending the `ExtendableClip`, exactly as `BrowserClip`
  does on our implementation
- For the needs of our Browser Clip we have also implemented the OriginalCASIClip which implements
  a Clip when the Browser Clip is initialised as CASI (this means it takes a selector instead of a host)
  on its properties

The full implementation of Browser Clip consists of:

- These two Clip implementations along with their Context Hanlders
- The DescriptiveClip of the Browser Clip located on `DescriptiveIncidents/Browser`
