## The Clip

### Definition

The Clip in MotorCortex is en entity that has the following characteristics:

- It has (and owns) a context
- It has a timeline (as it extends Group)
- It can accept any Group, Effect or other Clip on its timeline
- It owns and handles its Channels
- It handles / checks and applies `add`, `edit`, `move`, `resize` and `remove` Incidents functionality
- It's playable

### The Context

The key-word to notice on these characteristics is the "context". The context is
anything that contains elements that can be accessed via selectors. <i>the implemented
and provided by MotorCortex, "BrowserClip" is just one of the possible implementations</i>

### Implementation

In order for any Developer to define a new Clip type in MC they need to follow these steps:

1. Create a folder for your Clip type inside `this` folder
2. Create your real Clip by extending ExtendableClip
3. Create your ContextHandler by extending the ContextHandler Class. Also, as part of this step
   define your props validation rules
4. Create your DescriptiveClip by extending the DescriptiveClip Class
5. Create an index.js file that exports an object with the keys:
   1. DescriptiveClip
   2. Clip
   3. validationRules

## ContextHandler

ContextHandler is a Class that actually implements / defines the context of a Clip type.
It is responsible for implementing the following methods

- getElements()
- getMCID()
- setMCID()
- getElementSelectorByMCID()
- contextLoaded
- unmout()

## ExtendableClip

Let's start by ExtendableClip. ExtendableClip has all the functionality of a MotorCortex Clip.
Any Clip implementation must extend it. What's needed from the developer is just to define
a context on the constructor of their Class (<i>More details on the file</i>)

What ExtendableClip already implements (and offers) is the following:

- Channeling: It's responsible for splitting Incidents into their Channels
- addIncident: checks and adds (or rejects) any Incident (including Groups)
- edit / remove Incident
- resize Incident

The only thing the ExtendableClip demands from its children (Classes that extend ExtendableClip) is to define the
property `this.ownContext` on their constructor. `this.ownContext` is an object which must include at least the following
properties (and methods:

- **getElements()** a method which takes in a selector and returns an array of elements
- **getMCID()** given an element it gives back an mc-id. If the element doesn't have an mc-id they should create one for the provided element
- **setMCID()** takes two arguments: element and mc-id and sets the mc-id to the element
- **getElementSelectorByMCID()** given an mc-id it returns a selector that selects the element that has it
- **getElementByMCID()** given an mc-id it returns the element
- **setCustomEntity()**
- isHostedClip
- contextLoaded
- rootElement
- clipContainer
- initParams
- unmout()

### The Context

### Usage and plugins

Plugin developers can extend BrowserClip in order to implement their own browser-targeting
Clip types or can extend ExtendableClip to implement any other type of Clip.
In both cases their new Clip must be placed on the "Clip" key of their plugin's
