# Splitters

When a DescriptiveIncident enters a Descriptive Tree (see folder `DescriptiveIncidents`), MotorCortex
"compiles" it to real Incidents on the "real" tree. Long story short, the "Descriptive" tree holds
a tree of "Descriptive" Incidents, just for the shake of the description / definition of the Clip.
Under the hood these "Descriptive" Incidents get "compiled" into many (from 1 to hundreds) "real"
Incidents.

The way MC does that is by the use of Splitters:

## Effects

- All Effects (that have a selector) are first split to many Incidents, one per element.
  This is done by `ElementSplitter`
- Each of the produced per-element incidents are further split per animatedAttribute. For example
  an Incident with two animatedAttrs (e.g. width and height) will be split by `AnimatedAttributeSplitter`
  into one-per-attribute Incidents
- The per-element-per-attribute-incidents are the real Incidents that actually run on MC. As an
  example an effect with selector '.box' which selects 3 elements, with two animated attributes will
  produce 3x2 = 6 real incidents.

As a notice the per-element-per-attribute incident is `ContextAwareIncident` which has further
logic implemented for the handling of CASIs.

## Clips

The exact same logic is followed when a CASI enters a Clip. The corresponding Classes for the
splitting of the Descriptive Incident are `ElementClipSplitter`, no attributes splitter here, and
the produced `ContextAwareClipIncident`.
