# ObjectProxy

createProxy is a method that takes in any array or object and returns
a proxy for it.

Whatever happens in proxies stays in the proxies.

This proxy allows you to edit or delete any key of the object, no matter the
level it exists within the object structure. It provides the ability to add
new entries on any array or object of the object's tree.
The Proxy provides the most basic attributes of normal arrays and objects, such
as "keys", "length", "hasOwnProperty".
It also provides higher level methods such as "sortBy" and "findIndex", mostly
targeting arrays and collections.
The export flattened() method returns a proxy-free, real object/array with
state identical to the proxy's.

The trade-off for using proxies is that you need to SET the value of any key
by the setValue method of the proxy, defining its path and new value. The rest
is up to proxy to handle.
