# Custom Validator
## API
MotorCortex validator is responsible for evaluating any given value against any schema. It's exposed on 
the `index` file on the root folder of it. It exposes two methods:
* `compile`: Takes one argument (schema) and provides back a compiled method to be used for validations
* `validate`: It takes two arguments (value, schema) and it returns the validation of the value against the 
schema. 

## Core
On the core of it there is a `fastest-validator` instance to which we've added some custom field types such
as `measurement` and `color`. This validator instance is not the one exposed by MC Validator API though. 

## Dynamic Values support
One layer above there is the actual `custom validator` exposed which uses the fastest-validator instance 
adding to it dynamic values validation capabilities. 
The way it does it is by scanning the provided schema and adding an alternative check for each field
of it before passing the schema further down to the fastest-validator instance 
(using [this](https://github.com/icebob/fastest-validator#multiple-validators) capability of `fastest-validator`).

This is performed by SchemaAdaptor class while the extra check added is a custom method defined on `dynamicValuesCheck` file. This method loads and uses the registered
dynamic values on the DVRegistry.
