# MC Template Engine

## Intro

MotorCortex provides a built-in Template Engine to serve the templating of html and css props of Clips.

MotorCortex's Template Engine:

- Does not use eval neither new Function, making it safe from code injection. It should never use neither of them as
  its number one priority is security.
- Supports exactly two structural directives:
  - loop (mc-for)
  - condition (mc-if)
- Supports value rendering

In case of HTML, the MC Template Engine demands the provided template to have a single root element that can (of course)
contain any HTML code.

## API

MC Template Engine exposes just one method: `parse`
