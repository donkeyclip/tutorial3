## How to report a bug

### Security issues

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [opensource@donkeyclip.com](mailto:opensource@donkeyclip.com) instead.

> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
>
> - Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> - Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at [opensource@donkeyclip.com](mailto:opensource@donkeyclip.com) .

### Other issue

When filing an issue, make sure to follow our [issue template](.github/issue_template.md)
