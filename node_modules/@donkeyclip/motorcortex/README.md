### MotorCortex is a dynamic video technology for the Web

What you can create with MotorCortex is `donkeyclips`.
donkeyclips are just dynamic video components that accept parameters on runtime. You can even
edit the donkeyclip on runtime by adding or removing `incidents`.

## Concepts

- Anything that occurs at a specific point in time and has a very specific duration is an `Incident`
- We separate `context` with `action`. `context` is your setting. E.g. in an HTML video your context would be
  the HTML and all of its elements, while on a 3D clip the `context` would be all the models, the lights etc.
  All of your available `material`.

  The `action` on the other hand is a change (e.g. color, movement, etc) that happens in and on the `context`.

- A full story, consisting of both **context** and action (**Incidents**) is called a **Clip**
- A full Clip can enter the timeline of another Clip taking both a “physical” and
  a time position on it
- Always at the top there is a root Clip, which is the only playable clip. We call it the `donkeyclip`

MotorCortex implements these concepts as es6 Classes providing all the
building blocks needed and an easy API to compose donkeyclips.

### Animations and Effects

All Classes are extendable making it
very easy to create:

- Animations: Pre-configured Clips with pre-configured (yet parametric) context and action
- Effects: Incidents that alter the state and attributes of elements of the context
- Totally new Clip types, such as canvas, audio etc.
  Animations, Effects and new Clip types can easily be exposed by Plugins.
